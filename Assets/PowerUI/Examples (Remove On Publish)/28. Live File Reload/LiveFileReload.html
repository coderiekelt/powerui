		<b>Welcome to PowerUI!</b>
		<br>
		<br>
		Here's a simple way to preview your UI's.
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Try editing the html file next to this scene</b> - pop it open in your favourite editor and make some changes. Then to see the result simply save it and click back on Unity. Your html will reload straight away.
		<br>
		<br>
		To do this in any scene, just use a "PowerUI Manager Live File" instead of the normal default "PowerUI Manager" (the script attached to a gameobject).
		<br>
		<br>
		<i>If you're wondering why this isn't the default, it's because of C#. Many people use C# to interact with or start up UI's, meaning the reloaded state would be pretty wrong!</i>
</div>
