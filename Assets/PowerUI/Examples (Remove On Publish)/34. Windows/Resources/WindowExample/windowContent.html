For the record, you could add head etc, but it's really not necessary.
As always, everything (including the title) can use localisation too!

	This is the window template for a <b>floating</b> window.
	<br><br>
	It was opened with the window:// url scheme - if you click it again, this window will close.
	<br><br>
	This window resizes and moves too - Drag either the window itself or the bottom right corner.

/* 
This version of Nitro is depreciated
but it demonstrates a simple way of passing variables to a window.

Calling sparkWindows.open or adding a query string to the window URL
will set global variables. They're available immediately!

------------------------
E.g. The window URL that loads up this content is..

window://floating/WindowExample/windowContent.html?hello=nitro

We'll get a global called 'hello' and it's value is 'nitro'.

*/

// Show it:
debug.log("The window URL set the hello global to:");
debug.log(hello);
