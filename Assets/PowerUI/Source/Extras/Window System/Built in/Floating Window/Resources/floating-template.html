	<!--
		Note! If you're making these templates, there must be exactly one root.
		Make sure there's no comments or text before/after the root element.
		E.g. make sure there's no newlines or spaces after the </div> in this case.
		Scripts won't run - put all your code into the C# file.
		CSS goes into {name}-style.html e.g. floating-style.html.
		That's because multiple windows might be opened.
