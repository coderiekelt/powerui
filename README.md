# PowerUI 2

The HTML UI framework and much more for the Unity Game Engine.

# Getting started
If you'd just like to explore PowerUI, [download the latest prebuilt package here](https://powerui.kulestar.com/download/). 
Once you've imported it into your project, open up the example scenes to take a look around.

If you'd like to grab PowerUI straight from this repository, make sure you do a recursive clone! 
See [the guide on the wiki](http://powerui.kulestar.com/wiki/index.php?title=Source_Control_(GIT)#Checking_it_out) for more details on pulling.
